this is the first project i'm taking on during TOP. it's a project to demonstrate what I learned so far.
I'll be creating a basic recipe website 
consisting of a main index page , that will have links to a couple of recipes .
For this first project I'll only be using HTML, only focusing on the content itself and not the visuals.
I'll be demonstrating HTML skills learned during this course.
