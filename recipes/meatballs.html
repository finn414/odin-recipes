    <h2>Garlic Butter Chicken Meatballs</h2>
    <p>The meatballs are tender and savory, and the sauce is cozy but bright. It's a meal that feels exactly right for this time of year. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finely grated zest of 1 medium lemon (about 1 1/2 teaspoons).</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves (from 1/2 medium bunch), plus more for serving.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves), divided.</li>
        <li>1 large egg.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano.</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground chicken.</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, divided.</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional).</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine.</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 medium lemon (about 2 tablespoons).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the finely grated zest of 1 medium lemon, 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves, 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs,1 1/2 teaspoons of the minced garlic, 1 large egg, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken and mix until evenly combined; do not overmix or the meatballs will be tough. Scoop out the mixture in heaping 2-tablespoon portions (about 20) and roll between damp hands until a smooth ball forms.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the unsalted butter in a 12-inch frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in a single layer and cook, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball registers at least 165Â°F, about 12 minutes total. Transfer to a clean plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, then melt the remaining 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in the pan. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic and 1 pinch red pepper flakes if desired. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and cook, stirring frequently, to remove the raw flour flavor, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk in 1/4 cup dry white wine, then scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth, the juice of 1 medium lemon juice, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 4 minutes. Return the meatballs to the skillet and toss to coat. Garnish with more chopped parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
