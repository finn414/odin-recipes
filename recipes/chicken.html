    <h2>Chicken Alfredo Pasta</h2>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a dream-team combination of juicy, golden-brown slices of chicken breast and long, slurp-able strands of thick fettuccine pasta in a super-creamy Alfredo pasta sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half pound of pasta (serves four people). Fettuccine is the most classic, but any type of pasta works.</li>
        <li>Heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Butter and oil.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Grated nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta in a large pot of salted water. Get this going before you start cooking the chicken and you can add the dried pasta right around the same time you start cooking the chicken breast. Save a cup of the pasta water to thin the sauce if needed.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken breasts in a combination of oil and butter for golden crispness, sear the chicken in a skillet.</li>    
        <li>Make Alfredo Sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>In the same skillet,melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic until fragrant and lightly browned</li>
                <li>Whisk the heavy cream into the butter until combined. Heat, whisking occasionally, until the cream simmers.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the Parmesan cheese, salt, nutmeg, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Cook until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
             
        <li> Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
    </ol>
